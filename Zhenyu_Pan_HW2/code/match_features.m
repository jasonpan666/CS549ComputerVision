% 'features1' and 'features2' are the n x feature dimensionality features
%   from the two images.
% If you want to include geometric verification in this stage, you can add
% the x and y locations of the features as additional inputs.
%
% 'matches' is a k x 2 matrix, where k is the number of matches. The first
%   column is an index in features1, the second column is an index
%   in features2. 
% 'Confidences' is a k x 1 matrix with a real valued confidence for every
%   match.
% 'matches' and 'confidences' can empty, e.g. 0x2 and 0x1.
function [matches, confidences] = match_features(features1, features2)

% This function does not need to be symmetric (e.g. it can produce
% different numbers of matches depending on the order of the arguments).

% To start with, simply implement the "ratio test", equation 4.18 in
% section 4.1.3 of Szeliski. For extra credit you can implement various
% forms of spatial verification of matches.

% Placeholder that you can delete. Random matches and confidences
% num_features = min(size(features1, 1), size(features2,1));
% matches = zeros(num_features, 2);
% matches(:,1) = randperm(num_features); 
% matches(:,2) = randperm(num_features);
% confidences = rand(num_features,1);

for i = 1 : size(features1, 1) 
    for j = 1 : size(features2, 1)
        % Euclidean norm between items in two features
        distance(j) = abs(norm(features1(i, :) - features2(j, :)));
    end
    [sorted, ind] = sort(distance, 'ascend');
    confidences(i) = sorted(1) / sorted(2);
    matches(i, 1) = i;
    matches(i, 2) = ind(1);
end

% Sort the matches so that the most confident onces are at the top of the
% list. You should probably not delete this, so that the evaluation
% functions can be run on the top matches easily.
[confidences, ind] = sort(confidences, 'descend');
matches = matches(ind,:);
